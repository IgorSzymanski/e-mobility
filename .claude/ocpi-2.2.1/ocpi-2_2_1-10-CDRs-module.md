## 10. CDRs module 

**Module Identifier: cdrs** 

**Data owner: CPO** 

**Type:** Functional Module 

A **Charge Detail Record** is the description of a concluded charging session. The CDR is the only billing-relevant object. CDRs are sent from the CPO to the eMSP after the charging session has ended. Although there is no requirement to send CDRs in (semi-) realtime, it is seen as good practice to send them as soon as possible. But if there is an agreement between parties to send them, for example, once a month, that is also allowed by OCPI. 

### 10.1. Flow and Lifecycle 

CDRs are created by the CPO. They most likely will be sent only to the eMSP that needs to pay the bill of the underlying charging session. Because a CDR is for billing purposes, it cannot be changed or replaced once sent to the eMSP. Changes are simply not allowed. Instead, a Credit CDR can be sent. 

CDRs may be sent for charging locations that have not been published via the Location module. This is typically for home chargers. 

###### 10.1.1. Credit CDRs 

As CDRs are used for billing and can be seen as a kind of invoice, they cannot be deleted. Instead, they have to be credited. 

When a CPO wants to make changes to a CDR that was already sent to the eMSP, the CPO has to send a Credit CDR for the first CDR. This credit CDR SHALL have a different CDR.id which can be a completely different number, or it can be the id of the original CDR with something appended like for example: -C to make it unique again. To indicate that a CDR is a Credit CDR, the credit field has to be set to true. The Credit CDR references the old CDR via the credit_reference_id field, which SHALL contain the id of the original CDR. The Credit CDR will contain all the data of the original CDR. Only the values in the total_cost field SHALL contain the negative amounts of the original CDR. 

After having sent the Credit CDR, the CPO can send a new CDR with a new unique ID and the fields: credit and credit_reference_id omitted. 

 NOTE How far back in time a CPO can send a Credit CDR is not defined by OCPI. It is up the business contracts between the different parties involved, as there might be local laws involved etc. 

###### 10.1.2. Push model 

When the CPO creates CDR(s) they push them to the relevant eMSP by calling POST on the eMSPs CDRs endpoint with the newly created CDR(s). A CPO is not required to send _all_ CDRs to _all_ eMSPs, it is allowed to only send CDRs to the eMSP that a CDR is relevant to. 

CDRs should contain enough information (dimensions) to allow the eMSP to validate the total cost. It is advised to send enough information to the eMSP so that they can calculate their own costs for billing their customers. An eMSP might have a very different contract/pricing model with their EV drivers than the tariff structure of the CPO. 


If the CPO, for any reason, wants to view a CDR it has posted to an eMSP’s system, the CPO can retrieve the CDR by performing a GET request on the eMSP’s CDRs endpoint at the URL returned in the response to the POST. 

###### 10.1.3. Pull model 

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call GET on the CPO’s CDRs endpoint to receive a list of CDRs. 

This GET can also be used in combination with the Push model to retrieve CDRs after the system (re-)connects to a CPO, to get a list of CDRs _missed_ during a downtime of the eMSP’s system. 

A CPO is not required to return all known CDRs, the CPO is allowed to return only the CDRs that are relevant for the requesting eMSP. 

### 10.2. Interfaces and Endpoints 

There are both, a Sender and a Receiver interface for CDRs. Depending on business requirements, parties can decide to use the Sender Interface (Pull model), or the Receiver Interface (Push model), or both. Push is the preferred model to use, because the Receiver will receive CDRs in semi-realtime when they are created by the CPO. 

###### 10.2.1. Sender Interface 

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO. 

The CDRs endpoint can be used to retrieve CDRs.

### 10.3. Object description 

###### 10.3.1. CDR Object 

The _CDR_ object describes the charging session and its costs, how these costs are composed, etc. 

The CDR object is different from the Session object. The Session object is dynamic as it reflects the current state of the charging session. The information is meant to be viewed by the driver while the charging session is ongoing. 

The CDR on the other hand can be thought of as _sealed_ , preserving the information valid at the moment in time the underlying session was started. This is a requirement of the main use case for CDRs, namely invoicing. If e.g. a street is renamed the day after a session took place, the driver should be presented with the name valid at the time the session was started. This guarantees that the CDR will be recognized as correct by the driver and is not going to be contested. 

The _CDR_ object shall always contain information like Location, EVSE, Tariffs and Token as they were **at the start** of the charging session. 

**ChargingPeriod:** A CPO SHALL at least start (and add) a ChargingPeriod every moment/event that has relevance for the total costs of a CDR. During a charging session, different parameters change all the time, like the amount of energy used, or the time of day. These changes can result in another Price Component of the Tariff becoming active. When another Price Component becomes active, the CPO SHALL add a new Charging Period with at least all the relevant information for the change to the other Price Component. The CPO is allowed to add more _in-between_ Charging Periods to a CDR though. 

Examples of additional Charging Periods that are required to be added because another Price Component is becoming active: 

- When an energy changes in price after 17:00. The CPO has to start a new Charging Period at 17:00. The CPO also     has to list the energy in kWh consumed until 17:00 in the Charging Period that ends at 17:00. 

- When the price of a energy is higher when the EV is charging faster than 32A, a new Charging Period has to be     added the moment the charging power goes over 32A. This may be a moment that is calculated by the CPO, as     the Charge Point might not send the information to the CPO, but it can be interpolated by the CPO using the     metering information before and after that moment. 

**step_size:** When calculating the cost of a charging session, step_size SHALL only be taken into account once per session for the TariffDimensionType ENERGY and once for PARKING_TIME and TIME combined. 

step_size is not taken into account when switching time based paying for charging to paying for parking (charging has stopped but EV still connected). Example: step_size for both charging (TIME) and parking is 5 minutes. After 21 minutes of charging, the EV is full but remains connected for 7 more minutes. The cost of charging will be calculated based on 21 minutes (not 25). The cost of parking will be calculated based on 10 minutes (step_size is 5). 

step_size is not taken into account when switching from (for example) one ENERGY based tariff element to another. This is also true when switch from one (TIME) based tariff element to another (TIME) based tariff element, and one 


PARKING_TIME tariff element to another PARKING_TIME based tariff element. Example: when charging is more expensive after 17:00. The step_size of the tariff before 17:00 will not be used when charging starts before 17:00 and ends after 17:00. Only the step_size of the tariff (PriceComponent) after 17:00 is taken into account, for the total of the same amount for the session. 

The step_size for the PriceComponent that is used to calculate the cost of such a 'last' ChargingPeriod SHALL be used. If the step_size differs for the different TariffElements, the step_size of the last relevant PriceComponent is used. 

The step_size is not taken into account when switching between two Tariffs Example: A driver selects a different Charging Preference profile_type during an ongoing charging session, the different profile might have a different tariff. 

The step_size uses the total amount of a certain unit used during a session, not only the last ChargingPeriod. In other words, when the price of energy per kWh or the price of time per hour differs during a session,only the total amount of energy or time is used in calculations with step_size. Example: Energy costs € 0.20 perkWh before 17:00 and € 0.27 per kWh after 17:00. Both Price Components have a step_size of 500 Wh. If a driver charges 4.3 kWh before 17:00 and 1.1 kWh after 17:00, a total of 5.4 kWh is charged. The step_size rounds this up to 5.5 kWh total. It does NOT round the energy used after 17:00 to 1.5 kWh. 

Example: Time costs € 5 per hour before 17:00 and € 7 per hour after 17:00. Both Price Components have a step_size of 10 minutes. If a driver charges 6 minutes before 17:00 and 22 minutes after 17:00, this makes a total of 28 minutes charging. The step_size rounds this up to 30 minutes total, so 24 minutes after 17:00 will be billed. It does NOT round the minutes after 17:00 to 30 minutes, which would have made a total of 36 minutes. 

In the cases that TIME and PARKING_TIME Tariff Elements are both used, step_size is only taken into account for the total parking duration` Example: Time spent charging costs € 1.00 per hour and time spent parking (not charging) costs € 2.00 per hour. Both Price Components have a step_size of 10 minutes. If a driver charges 21 minutes, and keeps his EV connected while it is full for another 16 minutes, then the step_size rounds the parking duration up to 20 minutes, making it a total of 41 minutes. Note that the charging duration is not rounded up, as it is followed by another time based period.

session_id CiString(36)? Unique ID of the Session for which this CDR is sent. Is only allowed to be omitted when the CPO has not implemented the Sessions module or this CDR is the result of a reservation that never became a charging session, thus no OCPI Session. 

cdr_token CdrToken 1 Token used to start this charging session, including all the relevant information to identify the unique token. 

auth_method AuthMethod 1 Method used for authentication. Multiple <mod_cdrs_authmethod_enum,AuthMethods>> are possible during a charging sessions, for example when the session was started with a reservation: ReserveNow: COMMAND. When the driver arrives and starts charging using a Token that is whitelisted: WHITELIST. The last method SHALL be used in the CDR. 

authorization_reference CiString(36)? Reference to the authorization given by the eMSP. When the eMSP provided an authorization_reference in either: realtime authorization, StartSession or ReserveNow, this field SHALL contain the same value. When different authorization_reference values have been given by the eMSP that are relevant to this Session, the last given value SHALL be used here. 

cdr_location CdrLocation 1 Location where the charging session took place, including only the relevant EVSE and Connector. 

meter_id string(255)? Identification of the Meter inside the Charge Point. 

currency string(3) 1 Currency of the CDR in ISO 4217 Code.

total_time_cost Price? Total sum of all the cost related to duration of charging during this transaction, in the specified currency. 

total_parking_time number? Total duration of the charging session where the EV was not charging (no energy was transferred between EVSE and EV), in hours. 

total_parking_cost Price? Total sum of all the cost related to parking of this transaction, including fixed price components, in the specified currency. 

total_reservation_cost Price? Total sum of all the cost related to a reservation of a Charge Point, including fixed price components, in the specified currency. 

remark string(255)? Optional remark, can be used to provide additional human readable information to the CDR, for example: reason why a transaction was stopped. 

invoice_reference_id CiString(39)? This field can be used to reference an invoice, that will later be send for this CDR. Making it easier to link a CDR to a given invoice. Maybe even group CDRs that will be on the same invoice. 

credit boolean? When set to true, this is a Credit CDR, and the field credit_reference_id needs to be set as well. 

credit_reference_id CiString(39)? Is required to be set for a Credit CDR. This SHALL contain the id of the CDR for which this is a Credit CDR. 

home_charging_compens ation 

 boolean? When set to true, this CDR is for a charging session using the home charger of the EV Driver for which the energy cost needs to be financial compensated to the EV Driver. 

last_updated DateTime 1 Timestamp when this CDR was last updated (or created). 

 NOTE 

 The actual charging duration (energy being transferred between EVSE and EV) of a charging session can be calculated: total_charging_time = total_time total_parking_time. 

 NOTE 

 Having both a credit and a credit_reference_id might seem redundant. But it is seen as an advantage as a boolean flag used in queries is much faster than simple string comparison of references. 

 NOTE Different^ authorization_reference^ values might happen when for example a ReserveNow had a different authorization_reference then the value returned by a real-time authorization. 


 NOTE 

 When no start_date_time and/or end_date_time is known to the CPO, normally the CPO cannot send the CDR. If the MSP and CPO both agree that they accept CDRs that miss either or both the start_date_time and end_date_time, and local legislation allows billing of sessions where start_date_time and/or end_date_time are missing. Then, and only then, the CPO could send a CDR where the start_date_time and/or end_date_time are set to: "1970-1-1T00:00:00Z.

This enumeration contains allowed values for CdrDimensions, which are used to define dimensions of ChargingPeriods in both CDRs and Sessions. Some of these values are not useful for CDRs, and SHALL therefor only be used in Sessions, these are marked in the column: Session Only 

 Value Session Only 

 Description 

 CURRENT Y Average charging current during this ChargingPeriod: defined in A (Ampere). When negative, the current is flowing from the EV to the grid. 

 ENERGY Total amount of energy (dis-)charged during this ChargingPeriod: defined in kWh. When negative, more energy was feed into the grid then charged into the EV. Default step_size is 1. 

 ENERGY_EXPORT Y Total amount of energy feed back into the grid: defined in kWh. 

 ENERGY_IMPORT Y Total amount of energy charged, defined in kWh. 


 Value Session Only

 STATE_OF_CHARGE Y Current state of charge of the EV, in percentage, values allowed: 0 to 100. See note below. 

 TIME Time charging during this ChargingPeriod: defined in hours, default step_size multiplier is 1 second. 

 NOTE 

 OCPI makes it possible to provide SoC in the Session object. This information can be useful to show the current State of Charge to an EV driver during charging. Implementers should be aware that SoC is only available at some DC Chargers. Which is currently a small amount of the total amount of Charge Points. Of these DC Chargers, only a small percentage currently provides SoC via OCPP to the CPO. Then there is also the question if SoC is allowed to be provided to third-parties as it can be seen as privacy-sensitive information. So if an implementer wants to show SoC in, for example an App, care should be taken, to make the App work without SoC, as this will probably not always be available.
