## 8. Locations module 

**Module Identifier: locations** 

**Data owner: CPO** 

**Type:** Functional Module 

The Location objects live in the CPO back-end system. They describe the charging locations of an operator. 

**Module dependency:** the Receiver endpoint is dependent on the Tariffs module 

### 8.1. Flow and Lifecycle 

The Locations module has the Location as base object. Each Location can have multiple EVSEs (1:n) and each EVSE can have multiple Connectors (1:n). With the methods in the Receiver interface, Location data and status information can be shared with for example an eMSP and NSP. Updates can be made to a whole Location, but also only to an EVSE or a single Connector. 

When a CPO creates Location objects, it pushes them to connected eMSP by calling PUT on the Receivers Locations endpoint. eMSPs who do not support Push mode need to call GET on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the new object. This should be done regularly to stay up to date with the CPOs data, but not too often in order to keep the load low. 

If the CPO wants to replace a Location related object, they again push it to the eMSP systems by calling PUT on their Locations endpoint. 

Any changes to a Location related object can also be pushed to connected eMSPs by calling the PATCH method on the eMSPs Locations endpoint, but using PATCH mode, only actual changes should be pushed. Providers who do not support Push mode need to call GET on the CPOs Locations endpoint to receive the updates. 

When the CPO wants to delete an EVSE from the list of active EVSEs, they MUST update the EVSE’s status field to REMOVED and call the PUT or PATCH on the eMSP system. A Location without any valid EVSE object can be considered expired and should no longer be displayed. There is no way to entirely delete Locations, EVSEs and Connectors as there are other modules like sessions that depend on them. If it was possible to remove these objects, those links would no longer work. 

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSP’s system, the CPO can perform a GET request to validate the object in the eMSP’s system. 

Private charging Locations, that are not to be used for public charging, SHALL NOT be published via OCPI. 

###### 8.1.1. No public charging or roaming 

When a Location is not available for either Public Charging or Roaming, it is RECOMMENDED to NOT send that Location via OCPI to receiving parties. 

###### 8.1.2. Group of Charge Points 

OCPP 2.0 supports a 3-tier model: 


- Highest level is a Charge Point 

- A Charge Point can have one or more EVSEs. 

- Every EVSE can have one or more Connectors. 

OCPI does not have this model: 

- OCPI has Location at the highest level. 

- Each location can have multiple EVSE 

- Every EVSE can have one or more Connectors. 

When mapping OCPP Charge Points to OCPI, there are 2 options: 

- One Location for a group of Charge Points at the same location. (preferred) 

- One Location per Charge Point at the same location. 

OCPI prefers the first method. An EV driver does not care if a Location consists of one Charge Point with a very large amount of EVSEs, or a large amount of Charge Points with only one EVSE. The EV driver wants to know how many EVSEs are available. Grouping Charge Points in the same location into one OCPI Location will show better on a map that shows Charging Locations. 

 NOTE By definition, an EVSE can only charge one EV at a time. 

###### 8.1.3. OCPP 1.x Charge Points with multiple connectors per EVSE 

OCPP 1.x was not designed to support the 3-tier model. It had no notion of EVSEs. The Open Charge Alliance has written an Application Note: "Multiple Connectors per EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation" 

The workaround: 

- Define one 'virtual' EVSE per Connector. 

- When a connector of an hardware EVSE becomes unavailable, set all 'virtual' EVSEs for all the connectors of the     hardware EVSE to unavailable. etc. 

### 8.2. Interfaces and endpoints 

There are both, a Sender and a Receiver interface for Locations. It is advised to use the Push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation in order to keep the latency of updates low. The Sender interface is meant to be used when the connection between two parties is established for the first time, to retrieve the current list of Location objects with the current status, and when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Location cache is entirely upto-date (i.e. to perform a full sync). The Receiver can also use the Sender GET Object interface to retrieve a specific Location, EVSE or Connector. This feature might be used by an Receiver that wants information about a specific Location, but has not implemented the Receiver Locations interface (i.e. cannot receive Push). 

###### 8.2.1. Sender Interface 

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO. 


 Method Description 

 GET Fetch a list of Locations, last updated between the {date_from} and {date_to} (paginated), or get a specific Location, EVSE or Connector. 

 POST n/a 

 PUT n/a 

 PATCH n/a 

 DELETE n/a 

**8.2.1.1. GET Method** 

Depending on the URL Segments provided, the GET request can either be used to retrieve information about a list of available Locations (with EVSEs and Connectors) at a CPO (GET List) or it can be used to retrieve information about one specific Location, EVSE or Connector (GET Object). 

**GET List: Request Parameters** 

Endpoint structure definition: 

{locations_endpoint_url}?[date_from={date_from}]&[date_to={date_to}]&[offset={offset}]&[limit={limit}] 

Examples: 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/locations/?date_from=2019-01-28T12:00:00&date_to=2019-01-29T12:00:00 

https://ocpi.server.com/2.2.1/locations/?offset=50 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/2.2.1/locations/?date_from=2019-01-29T12:00:00&limit=100 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/locations/?offset=50&limit=100 

If the optional parameters {date_from} and/or {date_to} are provided, only Locations with (last_updated) between the given {date_from} (including) and {date_to} (excluding) will be returned. In order for this to work properly, the following logic MUST be implemented accordingly: If an EVSE is updated, also the 'parent' Location’s last_updated field needs to be updated. Similarly, if a Connector is updated, the EVSE’s last_updated and the Location’s last_updated fields need to be updated. 

This request is paginated, it supports the pagination related URL parameters. 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 date_from DateTime no Only return Locations that have last_updated after or equal to this Date/Time (inclusive). 

 date_to DateTime no Only return Locations that have last_updated up to this Date/Time, but not including (exclusive). 

 offset int no The offset of the first object returned. Default is 0. 

 limit int no Maximum number of objects to GET. 


**GET List: Response Data** 

This endpoint returns a list of Location objects. The header will contain the pagination related headers. 

Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values. Any old information that is not specified in the response is considered no longer valid. For requests that use pagination, the response data provided by all the pages together is the new truth. Any old information not contained in any of the pages needs to be considered no longer valid.

 Description 

 Location * List of all Locations with valid EVSEs. 

**GET Object: Request Parameters** 

Endpoint structure definition for retrieving a Location, EVSE or Connector: 

{locations_endpoint_url}/{location_id}[/{evse_uid}][/{connector_id}] 

Examples: 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/locations/LOC1

The following parameters can be provided as URL segments in the same order. 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 location_id CiString(36) yes Location.id of the Location object to retrieve. 

 evse_uid CiString(36) no Evse.uid, required when requesting an EVSE or Connector object. 

 connector_id CiString(36) no Connector.id, required when requesting a Connector object. 

**GET Object: Response Data** 

The response contains the requested object. 

 Type Card . 

 Description 

 Choice: one of three 

 > Location 1 If a Location object was requested: the Location object. 

 > EVSE 1 If an EVSE object was requested: the EVSE object. 

 > Connector 1 If a Connector object was requested: the Connector object. 


###### 8.2.2. Receiver Interface 

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP and NSP. 

Locations are Client Owned Objects, so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {party_id} and {country_code}. 

Endpoint structure definition: 

{locations_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{location_id}[/{evse_uid}][/{connector_id}] 

Examples: 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/BE/BEC/LOC1 

https://server.com/ocpi/2.2.1/locations/BE/BEC/LOC1/3256 

https://ocpi.server.com/2.2.1/locations/BE/BEC/LOC1/3256/1 

 Method Description 

 GET Retrieve a Location as it is stored in the eMSP system. 

 POST n/a (use PUT) 

 PUT Push new/updated Location, EVSE and/or Connector to the eMSP. 

 PATCH Notify the eMSP of partial updates to a Location, EVSE or Connector (such as the status). 

 DELETE n/a (use PATCH to update the status to REMOVED as described in Flow and Lifecycle) 

**8.2.2.1. GET Method** 

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Location, EVSE or Connector object in the eMSP system, it might GET the object from the eMSP system for validation purposes. The CPO is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the eMSP system had a different status or was missing an object. If a discrepancy is found, the CPO might push an update to the eMSP via a PUT or PATCH call. 

**Request Parameters** 

The following parameters can be provided as URL segments. 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 country_code CiString(2) yes Country code of the CPO requesting data from the eMSP system. 

 party_id CiString(3) yes Party ID (Provider ID) of the CPO requesting data from the eMSP system. 

 location_id CiString(36) yes Location.id of the Location object to retrieve. 

 evse_uid CiString(36) no Evse.uid, required when requesting an EVSE or Connector object. 

 connector_id CiString(36) no Connector.id, required when requesting a Connector object. 


**Response Data** 

The response contains the requested object. 

 Type Card . 

 Description 

 Choice: one of three 

 > Location 1 If a Location object was requested: the Location object. 

 > EVSE 1 If an EVSE object was requested: the EVSE object. 

 > Connector 1 If a Connector object was requested: the Connector object. 

**8.2.2.2. PUT Method** 

The CPO pushes available Location, EVSE or Connector objects to the eMSP. PUT can be used to send new Location objects to the eMSP but also to replace existing Locations. 

When the PUT only contains a Connector Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent EVSE and Location Objects. 

When the PUT only contains a EVSE Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent Location Object. 

**Request Parameters** 

This is an information Push message, the objects pushed will not be owned by the eMSP. To make distinctions between objects being pushed to an eMSP from different CPOs, the {party_id} and {country_code} have to be included in the URL (as URL segments, as described in the Receiver Interface). 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 country_code CiString(2) yes Country code of the CPO requesting this PUT to the eMSP system. This SHALL be the same value as the country_code in the Location object being pushed. 

 party_id CiString(3) yes Party ID (Provider ID) of the CPO requesting this PUT to the eMSP system. This SHALL be the same value as the party_id in the Location object being pushed. 

 location_id CiString(36) yes Location.id of the new Location object, or the Location of which an EVSE or Connector object is pushed. 

 evse_uid CiString(36) no Evse.uid, required when an EVSE or Connector object is pushed. 

 connector_id CiString(36) no Connector.id, required when a Connector object is pushed. 

**Request Body** 

The request body contains the new/updated object. 

When the PUT contains a Connector Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent EVSE and Location Objects. 


When the PUT contains a EVSE Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent Location Object. 

 Type Card . 

 Description 

 Choice: one of three 

 > Location 1 New Location object, or Location object to replace. 

 > EVSE 1 New EVSE object, or EVSE object to replace. 

 > Connector 1 New Connector object, or Connector object to replace. 

**Example: add an EVSE** 

To add an _EVSE_ , simply put the full object in an update message, including all its required fields. Since the id will be new to the eMSP’s system, the receiving party will know that it is a new object. When not all required fields are specified, the object may be discarded. 

 PUT To URL: https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/NL/TNM/1012/3256 { "uid": "3256", "evse_id": "BE*BEC*E041503003", "status": "AVAILABLE", "capabilities": ["RESERVABLE"], "connectors": [ { "id": "1", "standard": "IEC_62196_T2", "format": "SOCKET", "tariff_ids": ["14"] } ], "floor": -1, "physical_reference": 3, "last_updated": "2019-06-24T12:39:09Z" } 

**8.2.2.3. PATCH Method** 

Same as the PUT method, but only the fields/objects that have to be updated have to be present. Other fields/objects that are not specified as part of the request are considered unchanged. Therefore, this method is not suitable to remove information shared earlier. 

Any request to the PATCH method SHALL contain the last_updated field. 

When the PATCH is on a Connector Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent EVSE and Location Objects. 

When the PATCH is on a EVSE Object, the Receiver SHALL also set the new last_updated value on the parent Location Object. 

**Example: a simple status update** 

This is the most common type of update message. It is used to notify eMSPs that the status of an EVSE changed. In 


this case it is the EVSE with uid 3255 of the Location with id 1012. 

 PATCH To URL: https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/NL/TNM/1012/3255 { "status": "CHARGING", "last_updated": "2019-06-24T12:39:09Z" } 

**Example: change the location name** 

In this example the name of the Location with id 1012 is being updated. 

 PATCH To URL: https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/NL/TNM/1012 

 { "name": "Interparking Gent Zuid", "last_updated": "2019-06-24T12:39:09Z" } 

**Example: set tariff update** 

In this example Connector 2 of EVSE 1 of Location 1012 receives a new pricing scheme. 

 PATCH To URL: https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/NL/TNM/1012/3255/2 { "tariff_ids": ["15"], "last_updated": "2019-06-24T12:39:09Z" } 

**Example: delete an EVSE** 

An EVSE can be deleted by updating its status property. 

 PATCH To URL: https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/locations/NL/TNM/1012/3256 { "status": "REMOVED", "last_updated": "2019-06-24T12:39:09Z" } 

 NOTE To inform eMSPs that an EVSE is scheduled for removal, the status_schedule field can be used._

###### 8.3.1. Location Object 

The _Location_ object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSEs that belong together are installed. Typically, the _Location_ object is the exact location of the group of EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage which contains these EVSEs. The exact way to reach each EVSE can be further specified by its own properties. 

Locations may be shown in apps or on websites etc. when the flag: publish is set to true. Locations that have this flag set to false SHALL not be shown in an app or on a website etc. unless it is to the owner of a Token in the publish_allowed_to list. Even parties like NSP or eMSP that do not 'own' this Token MAY show this location on an app or website, but only to the owner of that Token. If the user of their app/website has provided information about his/her Token, And that information matches all the fields of one of the PublishToken tokens in the list, then they are allowed to show this location to their user. It is not allowed in OCPI to use a Token that is not 'owned' by the eMSP itself to start a charging session. 

 Property Type Card .

**8.3.1.1. Example public charging location** 

This is an example of a public charging location. Can be used by any EV Driver as long as his eMSP has a roaming agreement with the CPO. Or the Charge Point has an ad-hoc payment possibility

**8.3.1.2. Example destination charging location** 

This is an example of a destination charging location. This is a Location where only guests, employees or customers can charge. For an EV driver, it can be useful to know if he/she can charge at his destination. 

For example at a restaurant, only customers of the restaurant can charge their EV. Or at an office building where employees and guest of the office can charge their EV. 

Locations you can think of where this is useful: restaurants, bars, clubs, theme parks, stores, supermarkets, company building, office buildings, etc.

**8.3.1.3. Example destination charging location not published, but paid guest usage possible** 

This is an example of a destination charging location. But the owner of the location has requested not to publish the location in Apps or on websites. 

Charging is still possible: EV drivers of an eMSP with a roaming agreement can still charge their EV. The eMSP helpdesk can use the information from the Location module to help the driver, maybe even start a session for a driver. Starting a session from an App is not possible, because the driver will not be able to select the Charge Point on a map. 

In case the EV driver is not billed for charging, there is, in such a case, no reason to publish the location via OCPI.

**8.3.1.4. Example charging location with limited visibility** 

This is an example of a charging location that only a limited group can see (and use) via an App or website. 

Typical examples where this is useful: 

- Charge Points in the parking garage of an apartment building. Only owners can see/control the Charge Points. 

- Charge Points at an office, for employees only. Only employees can see/control the Charge Points. 

- Charge Points at vehicle depot. Any employee can see/control an charge point, even transaction they did not     start. Use group_id for this. 

The locations SHALL NOT be published to the general public. Only selected Tokens can see (and control) the Charge Points via eMSP app. 

- publish = false

###### 8.3.2. EVSE Object 

The _EVSE_ object describes the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. It always belongs to a Location object. The object only contains directions to get from the location itself to the EVSE (i.e. _floor_ , _physical_reference_ or _directions_ ). 

When the directional properties of an EVSE are insufficient to reach the EVSE from the _Location_ point, then it typically indicates that the EVSE should be put in a different _Location_ object (sometimes with the same address but with different coordinates/directions). 

An _EVSE_ object has a list of Connectors which can not be used simultaneously: only one connector per EVSE can be used at the time. 


**Property Type Card .** 

 Description 

uid CiString(36) 1 Uniquely identifies the EVSE within the CPOs platform (and suboperator platforms). This field can never be changed, modified or renamed. This is the 'technical' identification of the EVSE, not to be used as 'human readable' identification, use the field evse_id for that. This field is named uid instead of id, because id could be confused with evse_id which is an eMI3 defined field. Note that in order to fulfill both the requirement that an EVSE’s uid be unique within a CPO’s platform and the requirement that EVSEs are never deleted, a CPO will typically want to avoid using identifiers of the physical hardware for this uid property. If they do use such a physical identifier, they will find themselves breaking the uniqueness requirement for uid when the same physical EVSE is redeployed at another Location. 

evse_id CiString(48)? Compliant with the following specification for EVSE ID from "eMI3 standard version V1.0" (http://emi3group.com/documents-links/) "Part 2: business objects." Optional because: if an evse_id is to be re-used in the real world, the evse_id can be removed from an EVSE object if the status is set to REMOVED. 

status Status 1 Indicates the current status of the EVSE. 

status_schedule StatusSchedule * Indicates a planned status update of the EVSE. 

capabilities Capability * List of functionalities that the EVSE is capable of. 

connectors Connector + List of available connectors on the EVSE. 

floor_level string(4)? Level on which the Charge Point is located (in garage buildings) in the locally displayed numbering scheme. 

coordinates GeoLocation? Coordinates of the EVSE. 

physical_reference string(16)? A number/string printed on the outside of the EVSE for visual identification. 

directions DisplayText * Multi-language human-readable directions when more detailed information on how to reach the EVSE from the _Location_ is required. 

parking_restrictions ParkingRestricti on 

 * The restrictions that apply to the parking spot. 

images Image * Links to images related to the EVSE such as photos or logos. 

last_updated DateTime 1 Timestamp when this EVSE or one of its Connectors was last updated (or created). 

 NOTE 

 OCPP 1.x does not have good support for Charge Points that have multiple connectors per EVSE. To make StartSession over OCPI work, the CPO SHOULD present the different connectors of an EVSE as separate EVSE, as is also written by the OCA in the application note: "Multiple Connectors per 


 EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation". 

###### 8.3.3. Connector Object 

A _Connector_ is the _socket_ or _cable and plug_ available for the EV to use. A single EVSE may provide multiple Connectors but only one of them can be in use at the same time. A Connector always belongs to an EVSE object. 

 Property Type Card . 

 Description 

 id CiString(36) 1 Identifier of the Connector within the EVSE. Two Connectors may have the same id as long as they do not belong to the same EVSE object. 

 standard ConnectorType 1 The standard of the installed connector. 

 format ConnectorForm at 

 1 The format (socket/cable) of the installed connector. 

 power_type PowerType 1 

 max_voltage int 1 Maximum voltage of the connector (line to neutral for AC_3_PHASE), in volt [V]. For example: DC Chargers might vary the voltage during charging when battery almost full. max_amperage int 1 Maximum amperage of the connector, in ampere [A]. 

 max_electric_power int? Maximum electric power that can be delivered by this connector, in Watts (W). When the maximum electric power is lower than the calculated value from voltage and amperage, this value should be set. For example: A DC Charge Point which can delivers up to 920V and up to 400A can be limited to a maximum of 150kW (max_electric_power = 150000). Depending on the car, it may supply max voltage or current, but not both at the same time. For AC Charge Points, the amount of phases used can also have influence on the maximum power. 

 tariff_ids CiString(36) * Identifiers of the currently valid charging tariffs. Multiple tariffs are possible, but only one of each Tariff.type can be active at the same time. Tariffs with the same type are only allowed if they are not active at the same time: start_date_time and end_date_time period not overlapping. When preference-based smart charging is supported, one tariff for every possible ProfileType should be provided. These tell the user about the options they have at this Connector, and what the tariff is for every option. For a "free of charge" tariff, this field should be set and point to a defined "free of charge" tariff. 

 terms_and_conditions URL? URL to the operator’s terms and conditions. 

 last_updated DateTime 1 Timestamp when this Connector was last updated (or created).
