## 11. Tariffs module 

**Module Identifier: tariffs** 

**Data owner: CPO** 

**Type:** Functional Module 

The Tariffs module gives eMSPs information about the tariffs used by the CPO. 

### 11.1. Flow and Lifecycle 

###### 11.1.1. Push model 

When the CPO creates a new Tariff they push them to the eMSPs by calling the PUT method on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the newly created Tariff object. 

Any changes to the Tariff(s) in the CPO’s system can be sent to the eMSPs systems by calling the PUT method on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the updated Tariff object. 

When the CPO deletes a Tariff, they will update the eMSPs systems by calling DELETE on the eMSPs Tariffs endpoint with the ID of the Tariff that was deleted. 

When the CPO is not sure about the state or existence of a Tariff object in the system of an eMSP, the CPO can use a GET request to validate the Tariff object in the eMSP’s system. 

###### 11.1.2. Pull model 

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call GET on the CPO’s Tariff endpoint to receive all Tariffs, replacing the current list of known Tariffs with the newly received list. 

### 11.2. Interfaces and Endpoints 

There is both a Sender and a Receiver interface for Tariffs. Advised is to use the push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation. The Sender interface is meant to be used when the connection between two parties is established to retrieve the current list of Tariffs objects, and when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Tariff cache is still up-to-date. 

###### 11.2.1. Sender Interface 

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO. 

The Sender’s Tariffs interface gives the Receiver the ability to request Tariffs information. 

 Method Description 

 GET Returns Tariff objects from the CPO, last updated between the {date_from} and {date_to} (paginated) 

 POST n/a 


 Method Description 

 PUT n/a 

 PATCH n/a 

 DELETE n/a 

**11.2.1.1. GET Method** 

Fetch information about all Tariffs. 

Endpoint structure definition: 

{tariffs_endpoint_url}?[date_from={date_from}]&[date_to={date_to}]&[offset={offset}]&[limit={limit}] 

Examples: 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/tariffs/?date_from=2019-01-28T12:00:00&date_to=2019-01-29T12:00:00 

https://ocpi.server.com/2.2.1/tariffs/?offset=50 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/2.2.1/tariffs/?date_from=2019-01-29T12:00:00&limit=100 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/tariffs/?offset=50&limit=100 

**Request Parameters** 

If additional parameters: {date_from} and/or {date_to} are provided, only Tariffs with last_updated between the given {date_from} (including) and {date_to} (excluding) will be returned. 

This request is paginated, it supports the pagination related URL parameters. 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 date_from DateTime no Only return Tariffs that have last_updated after or equal to this Date/Time (inclusive). date_to DateTime no Only return Tariffs that have last_updated up to this Date/Time, but not including (exclusive). 

 offset int no The offset of the first object returned. Default is 0. 

 limit int no Maximum number of objects to GET. 

**Response Data** 

The endpoint returns an object with a list of valid Tariffs, the header will contain the pagination related headers. 

Any older information that is not specified in the response is considered no longer valid. Each object must contain all required fields. Fields that are not specified may be considered as null values. 


 Type Card . 

 Description 

 Tariff * List of all tariffs. 

###### 11.2.2. Receiver Interface 

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP and NSP. 

Tariffs are Client Owned Objects, so the endpoints need to contain the required extra fields: {party_id} and {country_code}. 

Endpoint structure definition: 

{tariffs_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{tariff_id} 

Example: 

https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/tariffs/BE/BEC/12 

 Method Description 

 GET Retrieve a Tariff as it is stored in the eMSP’s system. 

 POST n/a 

 PUT Push new/updated Tariff object to the eMSP. 

 PATCH n/a 

 DELETE Remove a Tariff object which is no longer in use and will not be used in future either. 

**11.2.2.1. GET Method** 

If the CPO wants to check the status of a Tariff in the eMSP’s system, it might GET the object from the eMSP’s system for validation purposes. After all, the CPO is the owner of the object, so it would be illogical if the eMSP’s system had a different status or was missing the object entirely. 

**Request Parameters** 

The following parameters SHALL be provided as URL segments. 

 Parameter Datatype Requ ired 

 Description 

 country_code CiString(2) yes Country code of the CPO performing the GET request on the eMSP’s system.

### 11.3. Object description 

###### 11.3.1. Tariff Object 

A Tariff object consists of a list of one or more Tariff Elements, which in turn consist of Price Components. 

A Tariff Element is a group of Price Components that apply under the same conditions. The rules for the conditions under which a Tariff Element applies are known as its "restrictions". 

A Price Component describes how the usage of a particular dimension (time, energy, etcetera) is mapped to an amount of money owed. 

This system of Tariffs, Tariff Elements and Price Components can be used to create complex Tariff structures. 

When the list of Tariff Elements contains more than one Element that has a Price Component for a certain dimension, then the first Tariff Element with a Price Component for that dimension in the list with matching Tariff Restrictions will be used. Only one Price Component per dimension can be active at any point in time, but multiple Price Components for different dimensions can be active at once. That is you can have an ENERGY component and a TIME component active at the same time, but only those ones that are in the first Tariff Element that has a Price Component for that dimension and that has restrictions that match at that time. 

When no Tariff Element with a specific Dimension is found for which the Restrictions match, and there is no Tariff Element in the list with the given Dimension without Restrictions, there will be no costs for that Tariff Dimension. 

It is advised to always add a "default" Price Component per dimension. 

This can be achieved by adding a Tariff Element without restrictions after all other occurrences of the same dimension in the list of Tariff Elements. 


Such a Tariff Element will act as fallback when there is no other Tariff Element that has matching restrictions and that contains a Price Component for that dimension. 

To define a "Free of Charge" tariff in OCPI, a Tariff containing one Tariff Element with no restrictions containing one Price Component with type = FLAT and price = 0.00 has to be provided. 

See: Free of Charge Tariff example 

 NOTE 

 There are no parameters related to price rounding in the Tariff object or any of it constituent objects. Nor does the specification text of this module give any requirements about how to do price rounding. The reason for this that price rounding has to be done according to rules and restrictions set by applicable laws, contracts between the parties using OCPI and the currency used. The OCPI specification stays out of these matters. 

 Property Type Card . 

 Description 

 country_code CiString(2) 1 ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code of the CPO that owns this Tariff. 

 party_id CiString(3) 1 ID of the CPO that 'owns' this Tariff (following the ISO-15118 standard). 

 id CiString(36) 1 Uniquely identifies the tariff within the CPO’s platform (and suboperator platforms). 

 currency string(3) 1 ISO-4217 code of the currency of this tariff. 

 type TariffType? Defines the type of the tariff. This allows for distinction in case of given Charging Preferences. When omitted, this tariff is valid for all sessions. 

 tariff_alt_text DisplayText * List of multi-language alternative tariff info texts. 

 tariff_alt_url URL? URL to a web page that contains an explanation of the tariff information in human readable form. 

 min_price Price? When this field is set, a Charging Session with this tariff will at least cost this amount. This is different from a FLAT fee (Start Tariff, Transaction Fee), as a FLAT fee is a fixed amount that has to be paid for any Charging Session. A minimum price indicates that when the cost of a Charging Session is lower than this amount, the cost of the Session will be equal to this amount. (Also see note below) 

 max_price Price? When this field is set, a Charging Session with this tariff will NOT cost more than this amount. (See note below) 

 elements TariffEleme nt 

 + List of Tariff Elements. 

 start_date_time DateTime? The time when this tariff becomes active, in UTC, time_zone field of the Location can be used to convert to local time. Typically used for a new tariff that is already given with the location, before it becomes active. (See note below) 

 end_date_time DateTime? The time after which this tariff is no longer valid, in UTC, time_zone field if the Location can be used to convert to local time. Typically used when this tariff is going to be replaced with a different tariff in the near future. (See note below) 


 Property Type Card . 

 Description 

 energy_mix EnergyMix? Details on the energy supplied with this tariff. 

 last_updated DateTime 1 Timestamp when this Tariff was last updated (or created). 

 NOTE 

 min_price: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where minimum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the minimum cost excluding VAT. So as a rule, they both apply: The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be lower than the min_price excluding VAT. The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be lower than the min_price including VAT. 

 NOTE 

 max_price: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where maximum cost including VAT is reached earlier or later than the maximum cost excluding VAT. So as a rule, they both apply: The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be higher than the max_price excluding VAT. The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be higher than the max_price including VAT. 

 NOTE 

 start_date_time and end_date_time: When the Tariff of a Charge Point (Location) is changed during an ongoing charging session, it is common to not switch the Tariff until the ongoing session is finished. But this is NOT a requirement of OCPI, it is even possible with OCPI. Changing tariffs during an ongoing session is in many countries not allowed by consumer legislation. When charging at a Charge Point, a driver accepts the tariff which is valid when they start their charging session. If the Tariff of the Charge Point would change during the charging session, the driver might get billed something they didn’t agree to when starting the session. 

 NOTE 

 The fields: tariff_alt_text and tariff_alt_url may be used separately, or in combination with each other or even combined with the structured list of Tariff Elements. When a Tariff contains both the tariff_alt_text and elements fields, the tariff_alt_text SHALL only contain additional tariff information in human-readable text, not the price information that is also available via the elements field. The reason for this is that the eMSP might have additional fees they want to include in communication with their customer. 

**11.3.1.1. Examples** 

In the following section, a few different pricing strategies will be explained with some Tariff examples. For simplicity, we will use the euro as the currency in all of the examples if not mentioned otherwise. 

**Simple Tariff example € 0.25 per kWh** 

- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 Wh 

This tariff will result in costs of € 5.00 (excl. VAT) or € 5.50 (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged. 

 { 


 "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "16", "currency": "EUR", "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "ENERGY", "price": 0.25, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 1 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-17T11:16:55Z" } 

**Tariff example € 0.25 per kWh + start fee** 

- Start or transaction fee 

- € 0.50 (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 Wh 

This tariff will result in total cost of € 5.50 (excl. VAT) or € 6.10 (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "17", "currency": "EUR", "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "FLAT", "price": 0.50, "vat": 20.0, "step_size": 1 }, { "type": "ENERGY", "price": 0.25, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 1 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-17T11:36:01Z" } 

**Tariff example € 0.25 per kWh + minimum price** 

- Minimum price     ◦ € 0.50 (excl. VAT)     ◦ € 0.55 (incl. VAT, which is 10%) 

- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 


- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 Wh 

This tariff will result in costs of € 5.00 (excl. VAT) or € 5.50 (incl. VAT) when 20 kWh are charged. But if less than 2 kWh is charged, € 0.50 (excl. VAT) or € 0.55 (incl. VAT) will be billed. 

This is different from a start fee as can be seen when compared to the example above. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "20", "currency": "EUR", "min_price": { "excl_vat": 0.50, "incl_vat": 0.55 }, "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "ENERGY", "price": 0.25, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 1 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-17T16:45:21Z" } 

**Tariff example € 0.25 per kWh + parking fee + start fee** 

- Start or transaction fee 

- € 0.50 (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 Wh 

- Parking 

- € 2.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Billed per 15 min (900 seconds) 

For a charging session where 20 kWh are charged and the vehicle is parked for 40 minutes after the session ended, this tariff will result in costs of € 7.00 (excl. VAT) or € 7.90 (incl. VAT). Because the parking time is billed per 15 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though they left 40 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "18", "currency": "EUR", 


 "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "FLAT", "price": 0.50, "vat": 20.0, "step_size": 1 }, { "type": "ENERGY", "price": 0.25, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 1 }, { "type": "PARKING_TIME", "price": 2.00, "vat": 20.0, "step_size": 900 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-17T11:44:10Z" } 

**Tariff example € 0.25 per kWh + start fee + max price + tariff end date** 

- Maximum price 

- € 10 (excl. VAT) 

- € 11 (incl. VAT, which is 10%) 

- Start or transaction fee 

- € 0.50 (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 Wh 

This tariff has an end date: 30 June 2019, which is typically used when a tariff is going to be replaced by a new tariff. A Connector of a Location can have multiple Tariffs (IDs) assigned. By assigning both, the old and the new tariff ID, they will automatically be replaced. It is not required to update all Locations at the same time, the old tariff can also be removed later. 

For a charging session where 50 kWh are charged, this tariff will result in costs of € 10.00 (excl. VAT) or € 11.00 (incl. VAT) due to the price limit. If only 30 kWh were charged, the costs would be € 8.00 (excl. VAT) and € 8.85 (incl. VAT), as the start fee combined with the energy costs would be lower than the defined max price. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "16", "currency": "EUR", "max_price": { "excl_vat": 10.00, "incl_vat": 11.00 }, "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "FLAT", 


 "price": 0.50, "vat": 20.0, "step_size": 1 }, { "type": "ENERGY", "price": 0.25, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 1 }] }], "end_date_time": "2019-06-30T23:59:59Z", "last_updated": "2018-12-17T17:15:01Z" } 

**Simple Tariff example € 2 per hour** 

An example of a tariff where the driver does not pay per kWh, but for the time of using the Charge Point. 

- Charging Time 

- € 2.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 min (60 seconds) 

As this is tariff only has a TIME price_component, the driver will not be billed for time they are not charging: PARKING_TIME 

For a charging session of 2.5 hours, this tariff will result in costs of € 5.00 (excl. VAT) or € 5.50 (incl. VAT). 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "12", "currency": "EUR", "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "TIME", "price": 2.00, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 60 }] }], "last_updated": "2015-06-29T20:39:09Z" } 

**Simple Tariff example € 3 per hour, € 5 per hour parking** 

Example of a tariff where the driver pays for the time of using the Charge Point, but pays more when the car is no longer charging, to discourage the EV driver of leaving his EV connected when it is already full. 

- Charging Time 

- € 3.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 1 min (60 seconds) 

- Parking 

- € 5.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 


- 20% VAT 

- Billed per 5 min (300 seconds) 

A charging session of 2.5 hours (charging), where the vehicle is parked for 42 more minutes after charging ended, results in a total session time of 150 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking). This session with this tariff will result in total cost of € 11.25 (excl. VAT) or € 12.75 (incl. VAT). Because the parking time is billed per 5 minutes, the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking even though they left 42 minutes after their vehicle stopped charging. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "21", "currency": "EUR", "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "TIME", "price": 3.00, "vat": 10.0, "step_size": 60 }, { "type": "PARKING_TIME", "price": 5.00, "vat": 20.0, "step_size": 300 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-17T17:00:43Z" } 

**Ad-Hoc simple Tariff example with multiple languages** 

For ad-hoc charging (paying for charging without a contract), the Tariff Elements are not as important. The eMSP is not involved when a driver uses ad-hoc payment at the Charge Point, so no CDR is sent to an eMSP. Having a good human readable text is much more useful. 

- Charging Time 

- € 1.90 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 5.2% VAT 

- Billed per 5 minutes (300 seconds) 

For a charging session of 2.5 hours, this tariff will result in costs of € 4.75 (excl. VAT) or € 5.00 (incl. VAT). 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "12", "currency": "EUR", "type": "AD_HOC_PAYMENT", "tariff_alt_text": [{ "language": "en", "text": "2.00 euro p/hour including VAT." }, { "language": "nl", "text": "2.00 euro p/uur inclusief BTW." }], "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "TIME", 


 "price": 1.90, "vat": 5.2, "step_size": 300 }] }], "last_updated": "2015-06-29T20:39:09Z" } 

**Ad-Hoc Tariff example not possible with OCPI** 

For this example, the credit card start tariff is € 0.50, but when using a debit card it is only € 0.25. 

Such a tariff cannot be modeled with OCPI. But by modeling it as € 0.50 start tariff where debit card users are given a discount in the final CDR of € 0.25, nobody is likely to complain. The tariff_alt_text explains this clearly. 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "19", "currency": "EUR", "type": "AD_HOC_PAYMENT", "tariff_alt_text": [{ "language": "en", "text": "2.00 euro p/hour, start tariff debit card: 0.25 euro, credit card: 0.50 euro including VAT." }, { "language": "nl", "text": "2.00 euro p/uur, starttarief bankpas: 0,25 euro, creditkaart: 0,50 euro inclusief BTW." }], "elements": [{ "price_components": [{ "type": "FLAT", "price": 0.40, "vat": 25.0, "step_size": 1 }, { "type": "TIME", "price": 1.90, "vat": 5.2, "step_size": 300 }] }], "last_updated": "2018-12-29T15:55:58Z" } 

**Simple Tariff example with alternative URL** 

This examples shows the use of tariff_alt_url. 

This examples shows a PROFILE_CHEAP tariff, which is a smart charging tariff. Drivers are able to select this tariff by setting the profile_type in their Charging Preferences to CHEAP. In such case, the price might not be fixed, but depend on the real-time energy prices. To explain this to the driver, a short text inside tariff_alt_text might not be the best solution. Showing a graph could be better. Therefore it is also possible to provide an URL in tariff_alt_url to a site that explains the tariff better and in more detail. 

- Start or transaction fee 

- € 0.50 (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 


- Energy 

- € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 0.1 kWh (100 Wh) 

For a charging session where 20.45 kWh are charged: this tariff will result in: 

- Start fee: € 0.50 (excl. VAT), € 0.60 (incl. VAT) 

- Energy costs: € 5.13 (excl. VAT), € 5.64 (incl. VAT) 

- Total: € 5.63 (excl. VAT), € 6.24 (incl. VAT) 

if the announced prices were billed. Because the energy is billed per 0.1 kWh, the driver has to pay for 20.5 kWh even though they only charged 20.45 kWh. 

The twist here is that this tariff makes use of tariff_alt_url which links to a page with real-time energy prices of the operator, where is shown that the actual price per kWh is different. With an assumed current energy price of € 0.22 per kWh (excl. VAT), which is shown or explained on the page linked by tariff_alt_url, the resulting costs: 

- Start fee: € 0.50 (excl. VAT), € 0.60 (incl. VAT) 

- Energy costs: € 4.51 (excl. VAT), € 4.96 (incl. VAT) 

- Total: € 5.01 (excl. VAT), € 5.56 (incl. VAT) 

A breakdown for computing the price as the elements field of the Tariff says, with an energy price of € 0.25 / kWh, is as follows: 

 Dimension Quantity Price ex VAT Cost ex VAT 

 VAT Cost inc VAT 

 Flat 1 0.50 0.50 20% 0.60 

 Energy 20.45 kWh 0.25 per kWh 5.13 10% 5.64 

 Total 5.63 6.24

**Complex Tariff example** 

- Start or transaction fee 

- € 2.50 (excl. VAT) 

- 15% VAT 

- Charging Time 

- When charging with less than 32A 

- € 1.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Billed per 15 min (900 seconds) 

- When charging with more than 32A on weekdays 

- € 2.00 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Billed per 10 min (600 seconds) 

- When charging with more than 32A on weekends 

- € 1.25 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 20% VAT 

- Billed per 10 min (600 seconds) 

- Parking 

- On weekdays between 09:00 and 18:00 

- € 5 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 5 min (300 seconds) 

- On Saturday between 10:00 and 17:00 

- € 6 per hour (excl. VAT) 

- 10% VAT 

- Billed per 5 min (300 seconds) 

For a charging session on a Monday morning starting at 09:30 which takes 2:45 hours (165 minutes), where the driver uses a maximum of 16A of current and is parking for additional 42 minutes afterwards, this tariff will result in costs of € 9.00 (excl. VAT) or € 10.30 (incl. VAT) for a total session time of 165 minutes (charging) + 42 minutes (parking). 

A breakdown is as follows:

 Parking time 45 minutes 5.00 per hour 3.75 10% 4.125 

 Total 9.00 10.30 

The step_size of the last time-based period is 5 so the parking time duration of 42 minutes is rounded up to 45. As such the driver has to pay for 45 minutes of parking while they were actually only parking for 42 minutes. 

The charging time is not affected by step_size because it is followed by another time-based period. 

For a charging session on a Saturday afternoon starting at 13:30 which takes 1:54 hours (114 minutes), where the driver uses a minimum of 43A of current (all the time, which is only theoretically possible) and is parking for additional 71 minutes afterwards, this tariff will result in a total cost of € 12.28 (excl. VAT) or € 13.861 (incl. VAT). A breakdown is as follows:

 Parking time 75 minutes 6.00 per hour 7.50 10% 8.25 

 Total 12.28 13.861 

The cost for parking time is 7.50, reflecting 75 minutes of parking, because the step_size of the last time-based period is applied to the 71 actual minutes of parking. 

The charging time is again not affected by step_size because it is followed by parking time.

**Free of Charge Tariff example** 

In this example no VAT is given because it is not necessary (as the price is 0.00). This might not always be the case though and it is of course permitted to add a VAT, even if the price is set to zero.

###### 11.4.2. PriceComponent class 

A Price Component describes how a certain amount of a certain dimension being consumed translates into an amount of money owed. 

 Property Type Car d. 

 Description 

 type TariffDimensionType 1 The dimension that is being priced 

 price number 1 Price per unit (excl. VAT) for this dimension. 

 vat number? Applicable VAT percentage for this tariff dimension. If omitted, no VAT is applicable. Not providing a VAT is different from 0% VAT, which would be a value of 0.0 here. 

 step_size int 1 Minimum amount to be billed. That is, the dimension will be billed in this step_size blocks. Consumed amounts are rounded up to the smallest multiple of step_size that is greater than the consumed amount. For example: if type is TIME and step_size has a value of 300 , then time will be billed in blocks of 5 minutes. If 6 minutes were consumed, 10 minutes (2 blocks of step_size) will be billed. 

 NOTE 

 The step_size field is no longer present in OCPI 3.0. In OCPI 3.0, Parties are advised to measure quantities as precise as required by calibration law and use the full precision of such measurements in cost computation. Users of OCPI 2.2.1 looking to be ready for a transition to OCPI 3.0 or to maximize interoperability with OCPI 3.0 are advised to effectively avoid using step_size by setting step_size to 1 always. 

 NOTE 

 step_size: depends on the type and every type (except FLAT) defines a step_size multiplier, which is the size of every step for that type in the given unit. 

 For example: PARKING_TIME has the step_size multiplier: 1 second , which means that the step_size of a Price Component is multiplied by 1 second. Thus a step_size = 300 means 300 seconds ( 5 minutes). This means that when someone parked for 8 minutes they will be billed for 10 minutes. The parking time will be simply rounded up to the next larger chunk of step_size (i.e. blocks of 300 seconds in this example). 

 Another example: ENERGY has the step_size multiplied: 1 Wh , which means that the step_size of a Price Component is multiplied by 1 Wh. Thus a step_size = 1 with a price = 0.25 will result in a cost calculation that uses the charged Wh as precision. If someone charges their EV with 115.2 Wh, then they are billed for 116 Wh, resulting in total cost of € 0.029. 


 When step_size = 25, then the same amount would be billed for 101 to 125 Wh: € 0.031. When step_size = 500, then the same amount will be billed for 1 to 500 Wh: € 0.125. 

 NOTE For more information about how^ step_size^ impacts the calculation of the cost of charging see: CDR object description 

 NOTE 

 Take into account that using step_size can be confusing for Drivers and other people. There may be local or national regulations that regulate step_size. For example in The Netherlands telecom companies are required to at least offer one subscription which is paid per second. To prevent confusion by the customer, we recommend to keep the step_size as small as possible and mention them clearly in your offering. 

**11.4.2.1. Example Tariff** 

Example Tariff to explain the step_size when switching from one Tariff Element to another: 

- Charging fee of € 1.20 per hour (excl. VAT) before 17:00 with a step_size of 30 minutes (1800 seconds) 

- Charging fee of € 2.40 per hour (excl. VAT) after 17:00 with a step_size of 15 minutes (900 seconds) 

- Parking fee of € 1.00 per hour (excl. VAT) before 20:00 with a step_size of 15 minutes (900 seconds) 

 { "country_code": "DE", "party_id": "ALL", "id": "22", "currency": "EUR", "elements": [ { "price_components": [ { "type": "TIME", "price": 1.20, "step_size": 1800 }, { "type": "PARKING_TIME", "price": 1.00, "step_size": 900 } ], "restrictions" : { "start_time" : "00:00", "end_time" : "17:00" } }, { "price_components": [ { "type": "TIME", "price": 2.40, "step_size": 900 }, { "type": "PARKING_TIME", "price": 1.00, "step_size": 900 } ], "restrictions" : { "start_time" : "17:00", "end_time" : "20:00" 


 } }, { "price_components": [ { "type": "TIME", "price": 2.40, "step_size": 900 } ], "restrictions" : { "start_time" : "20:00", "end_time" : "00:00" } } ], "last_updated": "2018-12-18T17:07:11Z" } 

**Example: switching to different Tariff Element #1** 

An EV driver plugs in at 16:55 and charges for 10 minutes (TIME). They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 2 more minutes (PARKING_TIME). The total session time is therefore 12 minutes. The parking time of 2 minutes is rounded to 15 minutes according to the step size of the last parking time period. 

As a result,t he session costs € 0.55 ex VAT. 

A breakdown is as follows: 

 Dimension Quantity Price ex VAT Cost ex VAT 

 Charging time 5 minutes 1.20 per hour 0.10 Charging time 5 minutes 2.40 per hour 0.20 

 Time 15 minutes 1.00 per hour 0.25 

 Total 0.55 

**Example: switching to different Tariff Element #2** 

An EV driver plugs in at 16:35 and charges for 35 minutes (TIME). After that they immediately unplug and leave without parking time. 

As the charging time Price Component of the last Tariff Element being used has a step_size of 15 minutes, the total charging time is rounded up from 35 to 45 minutes. When considering the already billed 25 minutes of charging time before 17:00, we are left with 20 minutes to bill after 17:00. 

That leads to a session fee of € 1.30. A breakdown is as follows: 

 Dimension Quantity Price ex VAT Cost ex VAT 

 Charging time 25 minutes 1.20 per hour 0.50 

 Charging time 20 minutes 2.40 per hour 0.80 

 Total 1.30 


**Example: switching to Free-of-Charge Tariff Element** 

When parking becomes free after 20:00, there will not be an active PARKING_TIME Price Component nor a TIME Price Component. So the last parking period that needs to be paid, which is before 20:00, will be billed according to the step_size of the PARKING_TIME PriceComponent before 20:00. 

An EV driver plugs in at 19:40 and charges for 12 minutes (TIME). They then stop charging but stay plugged in for 20 more minutes (PARKING_TIME). The total session time is therefore 32 minutes. 

The total of billable parking time for the session is 8 minutes. This is rounded up to 15 minutes according to the step_size of the last time based Price Component that was active during the session. The extra 7 minutes are then added to the last period with a Price Component with a time-based dimension, that is the one from 19:52 to 20:00. So the user is billed € 0.60 for 15 minutes of parking and that makes a total session fee of € 0.80. 

A breakdown is as follows: 

 Dimension Quantity Price ex VAT Cost ex VAT Charging time 12 minutes 1.20 per hour 0.20 

 Time 15 minutes 2.40 per hour 0.60 

 Total 0.80 

###### 11.4.3. ReservationRestrictionType enum 

 Value Description RESERVATION Used in Tariff Elements to describe costs for a reservation. 

 RESERVATION_EXPIRES Used in Tariff Elements to describe costs for a reservation that expires (i.e. driver does not start a charging session before expiry_date of the reservation). 

 NOTE 

 When a Tariff has both RESERVATION and RESERVATION_EXPIRES Tariff Elements, where both Tariff Elements have a TIME Price Component, then the time based cost of an expired reservation will be calculated based on the RESERVATION_EXPIRES Tariff Element. 

###### 11.4.4. TariffElement class 

A Tariff Element is a group of Price Components that share a set of restrictions under which they apply. 

That the Price Components share the same restrictions does not mean that at any time, they either all apply or all do not apply. The reason is that applicable Price Components are looked up separately for each dimension, as described under the Tariff object. Therefore it is possible that a Price Component for one dimension is found in a Tariff Element that occurs earlier in the list of Tariff Elements than for another dimension. 

 Property Type Car d. 

 Description 

 price_component s

###### 11.4.5. TariffDimensionType enum 

 Value Description 

 ENERGY Defined in kWh, step_size multiplier: 1 Wh 

 FLAT Flat fee without unit for step_size 

 PARKING_TIME Time not charging: defined in hours, step_size multiplier: 1 second 

 TIME Time charging: defined in hours, step_size multiplier: 1 second Can also be used in combination with a RESERVATION restriction to describe the price of the reservation time. 

###### 11.4.6. TariffRestrictions class 

 A TariffRestrictions object describes if and when a Tariff Element becomes active or inactive during a Charging Session. 

These restrictions are not to be interpreted as making the Tariff Element applicable or not applicable for the entire Charging Session. 

When more than one restriction is set, they are to be treated as a logical AND. So a Tariff Element is active if and only if all of the properties in its TariffRestrictions match. 

 Property Type Card . 

 Description 

 start_time string(5)? Start time of day in local time, the time zone is defined in the time_zone field of the Location, for example 13:30, valid from this time of the day. Must be in 24h format with leading zeros. Hour/Minute separator: ":" Regex: ([0-1][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9] 

 end_time string(5)? End time of day in local time, the time zone is defined in the time_zone field of the Location, for example 19:45, valid until this time of the day. Same syntax as start_time. If end_time < start_time then the period wraps around to the next day. To stop at end of the day use: 00:00. 

 start_date string(10)? Start date in local time, the time zone is defined in the time_zone field of the Location, for example: 2015-12-24, valid from this day (inclusive).

 Description 

min_kwh number? Minimum consumed energy in kWh, for example 20, valid from this amount of energy (inclusive) being used. 

max_kwh number? Maximum consumed energy in kWh, for example 50, valid until this amount of energy (exclusive) being used. 

min_current number? Sum of the minimum current (in Amperes) over all phases, for example 5. When the EV is charging with more than, or equal to, the defined amount of current, this TariffElement is/becomes active. If the charging current is or becomes lower, this TariffElement is not or no longer valid and becomes inactive. This describes NOT the minimum current over the entire Charging Session. This restriction can make a TariffElement become active when the charging current is above the defined value, but the TariffElement MUST no longer be active when the charging current drops below the defined value. 

max_current number? Sum of the maximum current (in Amperes) over all phases, for example 20. When the EV is charging with less than the defined amount of current, this TariffElement becomes/is active. If the charging current is or becomes higher, this TariffElement is not or no longer valid and becomes inactive. This describes NOT the maximum current over the entire Charging Session. This restriction can make a TariffElement become active when the charging current is below this value, but the TariffElement MUST no longer be active when the charging current raises above the defined value. 

min_power number? Minimum power in kW, for example 5. When the EV is charging with more than, or equal to, the defined amount of power, this TariffElement is/becomes active. If the charging power is or becomes lower, this TariffElement is not or no longer valid and becomes inactive. This describes NOT the minimum power over the entire Charging Session. This restriction can make a TariffElement become active when the charging power is above this value, but the TariffElement MUST no longer be active when the charging power drops below the defined value. 

max_power number? Maximum power in kW, for example 20. When the EV is charging with less than the defined amount of power, this TariffElement becomes/is active. If the charging power is or becomes higher, this TariffElement is not or no longer valid and becomes inactive. This describes NOT the maximum power over the entire Charging Session. This restriction can make a TariffElement become active when the charging power is below this value, but the TariffElement MUST no longer be active when the charging power raises above the defined value.

 Description 

 max_duration int? Maximum duration in seconds the Charging Session MUST last (exclusive). When the duration of a Charging Session is shorter than the defined value, this TariffElement is or becomes active. After that moment, this TariffElement is no longer active. 

 day_of_week DayOfWeek * Which day(s) of the week this TariffElement is active. 

 reservation Reservation RestrictionT ype 

 ? When this field is present, the TariffElement describes reservation costs. A reservation starts when the reservation is made, and ends when the driver starts charging on the reserved EVSE/Location, or when the reservation expires. A reservation can only have: FLAT and TIME TariffDimensions, where TIME is for the duration of the reservation. 

**11.4.6.1. Example: Tariff with max_power Tariff Restrictions** 

Example Tariff to explain the max_power Tariff Restriction: 

- Charging fee of € 0.20 per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power of less than 16 kW. 

- Charging fee of € 0.35 per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power between 16 and 32 kW. 

- Charging fee of € 0.50 per kWh (excl. VAT) when charging with a power above 32 kW (implemented as fallback     tariff without Restriction). 

For a charging session where the EV charges the first kWh with a power of 6 kW, increases the power to 48 kW for the next 40 kWh and reduces it again to 4 kW after that for another 0.5 kWh (probably due to physical limitations, i.e. temperature of the battery), this tariff will result in costs of € 20.30 (excl.

**11.4.6.2. Example: Tariff with max_duration Tariff Restrictions** 

A supermarket wants to allow their customer to charge for free. As most customers will be out of the store in 20 minutes, they allow free charging for 30 minutes. If a customer charges longer than that, they will charge them the normal price per kWh. But as they want to discourage long usage of their Charge Points, charging becomes much more expensive after 1 hour: 

- First 30 minutes of charging is free. 

- Charging fee of € 0.25 per kWh (excl. VAT) after 30 minutes. 

- Charging fee of € 0.40 per kWh (excl. VAT) after 60 minutes. 

For a charging session with a duration of 40 minutes where 5 kWh are charged during the first 30 minutes and another 1.2 kWh in the remaining 10 minutes of the session, this tariff will result in costs of € 0.30 (excl. VAT). The costs are composed of the following components: 

- 5 kWh for free: € 0.00 

- 1.2 kWh at 0.25/kWh: € 0.30
